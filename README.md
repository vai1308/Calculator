# Calculator is a project that I created using math library and various math functions in python.
This calculator can perform upto 14 operations.
First I imported math module in the program.
After that I created various user defined functions, one for each operation to be performed.
I then printed the options of the operations to be performed.
Following which I gave the conditions to be followed by each operation.
And finally, I used the break keyword to skip the loop.
And hence, the program was completed.
